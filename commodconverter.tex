\subsection{Commodity Converter Facility}

One versatile facility model contributed by this work is the 
CommodityConverter, a simple representation of timed commodity transformation. After receiving a resource
(e.g., a material), this facility waits for a user-defined time period. Once
that time period has passed, the resource is offered to the resource exchange
system as a new commodity type. With this behavior, the Commodity Converter
facility is ideal for representing storage.  In that case, this model requests a commodity 
such as spent fuel, then waits for a cooling period before offering the same 
Material Resource as a cooled spent fuel Commodity.

Note that Commodity and Material are distinct concepts in the \Cyclus framework.
A Material is a subtype of Resource. All Resources have a Commodity type. A
single Material composition in \Cyclus can therefore be a ``fuel'' or``waste''
Commodity or any arbitrary string registered within the simulation, 
irrespective of the isotopic composition.
