\subsection{Commodity Converter Facility}

One versatile facility model contributed by this work is a simple 
representation of timed storage. After recieving material, this facility 
waits for a user-defined time period. Once that time period has passed, the 
material object is offered up as a new commodity type. 

In the case of a storage facility, for example, this model requests a commodity 
such as spent fuel, then waits for a cooling period before offering the same 
material as cooled spent fuel.
