\subsection{Stream Blender Facility : Fuel Fabrication}

The new Facility Model will handle the 'magical' transformation of various tru
and u streams into SFR fuel. The need for this is largely because the currently
available model in Cyclus for multi-stream fuel fabrication is quite detailed
and has conservation of mass and isotope checks. This level of detail would
slow down the simulation unnecessarily and  this "magic" scenario would fail
the physics checks. Thus, a simpler version of that model without all the
physics checks will be necessary. It should be quick ( a day ) to make.
