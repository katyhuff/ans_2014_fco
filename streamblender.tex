\subsection{Stream Blender Facility : Fuel Fabrication}

The process of fuel fabrication from separated elemental streams can most
concisely be described as a blending of streams. To most generically represent
this process, the Stream Blender Facility has been created.  This new Facility
Model handles the combination of various commodity streams in appropriate
proportions to acheive a goal recipe.
