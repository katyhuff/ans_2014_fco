\subsection{Deommissioning Institution}

The new Institution Agent will be based on an already existing institution
model, but will need to have a market-based look-ahead deployment capability to
faithfully model this scenario. We could actually get away with not doing this,
because currently, deployment scenarios based on pre-defined analytical
functions are possible, but I feel like that would be cheating and I think this
is a good chance to show off \Cyclus' flexibility. This might be slightly longer
to create ( a few days to write, a few days to debug ).
