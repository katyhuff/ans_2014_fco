The Cyclus Fuel Cycle Simulator \cite{carlsen_cyclus_2014} is a framework for 
assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. This simulation framework is 
incomplete without a suite of dynamically loadable libraries representing the 
process physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabrication, 
chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing, etc.).  In this work, support 
archetype models have been developed to extend the capabilities of the Cyclus 
ecosystem. Those model implementations are described as are the capabilities 
that they contribute. 

The Cyclus simulator provides some basic libraries within the additional 
modules repository, Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cyclus_2014}. However, extension of 
Cyclus with new capabilities is community-driven, relying on contributions by 
user-developers.  This summary describes a set of libraries that have been 
contibuted to the Cyclus framework to enable market-driven transition analyses. 

\subsection{Motivation}

To first order, the attractiveness of a new technology can be assessed by 
evaluating equilibrium fuel cycle scenarios, in which technologies are 
sufficiently mature. However, the dynamics of transition to such a scenario also 
contribute to the viability of deploying such a technology. 

For this reason, fuel cycle scenario analysis is often concerned with the 
transition from one reactor technology to another. Such analyses are termed 
``transition scenarios.''  Transition scenarios seek to model the real world 
dynamics of such a technology shift, in part to inform RD\&D decision-making. 

% Why did I do the work?
Transition scenarios are often modeled from a technology availability 
perspective, deploying new technologies based on their readiness.  Arguably, it 
is more realistic to drive a simulation based on market forces (i.e., material 
availability). In that case, technology readiness may be applied only as a 
constraint.

\subsection{Background}
% Who else has done what?
% How?

Fuel cycle simulators have previously acheived market-driven deployment 
capability using look-ahead algorithms for facility deployment 
\cite{schneider_nfcsim_2005}.  These simulators conduct guess-and-check 
simulation attempts, restarting or crashing if their algorithm failed to 
generate a coherent simulation.

% What has this group previously done?

The development version of the Cyclus simulator has long been capable of 
technology driven scenarios \cite{gidden_cyclus_2012}, those scenarios relied 
on explicit deployment profiles. This capability is equivalent to the 
guess-and-check methods of other simulators, as the user-defined deployment 
profiles may lead to incongruous scenarios leading to insufficient material or 
processing availability and unexpected idle facilities.  

However, the Cyclus simulator, due to its dynamic resource exchange paradigm, is capable
of dynamically checking material availability in the simulation and responding
accordingly.  

% Guidance to the reader

This summary describes the Agents added to the Cyclus simulator ecosystem that 
harness the resource exchange paragdigm to enable transition scenarios based on 
dynamic material availability in the resource exchange system. By emphasizing 
generality, these capabilities have been contributed to the Cyclus ecosystem as 
Agents.

Extensions to the Cyclus framework are necessary because the available
institution, region, and facility archetypes packaged with the Cycamore
repository are not sufficient to model the specific goals of all simulation 
descriptions.  In this case, Facility Agents were contributed to support fuel fabrication specifications in the transition scenario
definition of interest and an Institution Agent was contributed to support 
market-driven decommissioning of old technologies.  


This is a canonical example of the need for extension
capability in Cyclus. That is, each scenario specification of interest in fuel
cycle analysis is usually sufficiently pathological that modifications must
almost always be made in any simulation framework. The modularity built into
the Cyclus framework allows extension without modification of the core logic.
