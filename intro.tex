Extensions to the Cyclus framework are necessary because the 17 available
institution, region, and facility archetypes packaged with the Cycamore
repository are not quite sufficient to model the specific market-driven
deployment and fuel fabrication specifications in the transition scenario
definition of interest. This is a canonical example of the need for extension
capability in Cyclus. That is, each scenario specification of interest in fuel
cycle analysis is usually sufficiently pathological that modifications must
almost always be made in any simulation framework. The modularity built into
the Cyclus framework allows extension without modification of the core logic.  

In this work, support archetype models have been developed to extend the
capabilities of the Cyclus ecosystem. Those model implementations are described
as are the capabilities that they contribute.
