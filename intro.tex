The \Cyclus Fuel Cycle Simulator \cite{carlsen_cyclus_2014} is a framework for 
assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. This simulation framework is 
incomplete without a suite of dynamically loadable libraries representing the 
process physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabrication, 
chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing, etc.).  

Within the additional modules repository, Cycamore 
\cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014}, the \Cyclus ecosystem provides some basic 
libraries to represent these processes. However, extension of \Cyclus with new 
capabilities is community-driven, relying on contributions by user-developers.  
This summary describes a set of libraries that have been contibuted to the 
\Cyclus framework to enable market-driven transition analyses. 

\subsection{Motivation}

The attractiveness of a new technology can be assessed to first order by 
evaluating equilibrium fuel cycle scenarios. Equilibrium scenarios are those 
at steady state, in which technologies are deployed statically. However, 
transition dynamics leading up to that equilibrium state also contribute to 
the viability of deploying such a technology.  

For this reason, fuel cycle scenario analysis is often concerned with the 
transition from one reactor technology to another. Such analyses are termed 
``transition scenarios.''  Transition scenarios seek to model the real world 
dynamics of such a technology shift, in part to inform RD\&D decision-making. 

% Why did I do the work?
Transition scenarios are often modeled from a technology availability 
perspective, deploying new technologies based on their readiness.  Arguably, it 
is more realistic to drive a simulation based on market forces (i.e., material 
availability). In that case, technology readiness may be applied only as a 
constraint. 

% What will this work show?
This summary describes additions to the \Cyclus Fuel Cycle Simulator necessary 
to enable market-driven decommissioning and deployment for a specific, 
base-case scenario.

\subsection{Background}
% Who else has done what?
% How?

Previous fuel cycle simulators have previously achieved market-driven deployment 
capability using look-ahead algorithms for facility deployment 
\cite{schneider_nfcsim:_2005}.  These simulators typically conduct guess-and-check 
simulation attempts, restarting or crashing if their algorithm failed to 
generate a coherent simulation.

% What has this group previously done?

The development version of the \Cyclus simulator has long been capable of 
technology driven scenarios \cite{gidden_once_2012}, those scenarios relied 
on explicit demand or deployment profiles defined by the user. This capability 
shares the disadvantages of the guess-and-check methods of other simulators, 
since the user-defined deployment profiles may lead to incongruous scenarios 
(i.e., insufficient material or processing availability and unexpected idle 
facilities).  

However, the \Cyclus simulator, due to its dynamic resource exchange paradigm, 
is capable of dynamically checking material availability in the simulation and 
responding accordingly.  

% Guidance to the reader

By harnessing the \Cyclus resource exchange paradigm, and emphasizing 
generality, the Agents contributed in this work enable market-driven transition 
scenarios for a range of future use cases in the \Cyclus ecosystem.

Extensions to the \Cyclus framework are necessary because the available
institution, region, and facility archetypes packaged with the Cycamore
repository are not sufficient to model the specific goals of all simulation 
descriptions.  In this case, Facility Agents were contributed to support 
reprocessing and fuel fabrication specifications in the transition scenario
definition of interest and an Institution Agent was contributed to support 
market-driven decommissioning of old technologies.  


This is a canonical example of a user-developer's workflow for capability 
extension in \Cyclus. That is, each scenario specification of interest in fuel
cycle analysis is usually sufficiently pathological that modifications must
almost always be made in any simulation framework. This effort demonstrates how 
the modularity built into
the \Cyclus framework allows extension without modification of the core logic.
