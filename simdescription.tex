\subsection{Scenario Definition}
The simplified transition scenario modeled was from the current once-through
\gls{LWR} fuel cycle, to a fleet of \glspl{SFR}
with 100\% recycle of spent fuel.  The simulation starts in January 2014 and
lasts until transition to 100\% \glspl{SFR} is complete. The nuclear installed
capacity is constant (100GWe).

The transition is driven by the criteria that when sufficient separated
material is present, an LWR ($1000$MWe) should be decommissioned and replaced
with three ($333.\bar{3}$) SFRs. All facility implementations for the 
simulation are described in Table \ref{tab:facimpl}.

\subsubsection{Desired Outputs}

The desired outputs of this simulation include deployment metrics (i.e., the 
year during which the transition becomes complete). Additionally, installed 
capacity profiles should demonstrate that generating shortages do not occur. 
Key metrics also include material metrics such as separated surplus PU or TRU 
profiles, LWR used fuel reprocessing rate (t/yr), \gls{SFR} used fuel reprocessing 
rate (t/yr),  \gls{LWR} used fuel mass in storage (t), and \gls{SFR} used fuel mass in 
storage (t).

\subsubsection{Deployment Regions and Institutions}

In order to facilitate a deployment profile for the \gls{LWR} to \gls{SFR} transition, an 
existing Cycamore model was used. The GrowthRegion model maintains a 
power generation profile specified by the user. It does this by deploying or 
decommissioning reactors when necessary to maintain the specified growth 
profile.  

In this case, a constant 100GWe ``growth'' is maintained in the simulation. 
This region encapsulates all of the facilities in this simulation. 
When sufficient material is available to support a new set of three SFRs, an 
LWR is decommissioned. When power generating capacity is lost due to an LWR 
(1000MWe) decommissioning, the GrowthRegion deploys sufficient SFR capacity 
(three 333.3MWe SFRs) to replace it. 

An entity that decommissions LWRs based on material availability was not 
present in the default models, however. To support this ability, an extension 
model was implemented as a ``Market Driven Institution'' That model is 
addressed in Section \ref{sec:mktdriveninst}.

\subsubsection{Existing Facility Capabilities}

A number of exsiting capabilities were used to acheive this simulation. One is
the GrowthRegion, which can maintain a power profile according to a demand
curve. Another is the BatchReactor, which generically represents multi-batch 
reactor
models with fresh and spent fuel material compositions defined by the user. The
Source Facility and Sink Facility produce and consume material, respectively.
Accordingly, they represent the Mine and HLW Repository in this simulation.
