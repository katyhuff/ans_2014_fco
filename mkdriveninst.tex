\subsection{Market Driven Institution}
The new Institution Agent was based on an already existing institution
model, but required a market-driven deployment capability to
faithfully model this scenario. 

That is, by relying on inheritance from a mixin class already available within 
the \Cyclus toolkit, an institution can deploy and decommission facilities 
based on any decision criteria. By also relying on the dynamic resource 
exchange interface, it is possible to base that decision criteria on the 
availability of resources being offered by other facility agents in the 
simulation. 

In this case, a specific quantity of separated transuranic material must exist 
before an LWR can be decommissioned (to be replaced with three SFRs). That 
decision criteria, combined with the capability of decommissioning facilities, 
gives the Decommisioning Institution.
