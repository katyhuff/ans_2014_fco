To extend the capabilities of the \Cyclus ecosystem to include market-driven 
building and decommissioning, physics agnostic separations, simple storage, and 
source-preferential fuel fabrication, the following Agents were developed:

\begin{itemize}
\item SeparationsMatrix Facility, physics agnostic separations, (https://github.com/katyhuff/separationmatrix)
\item CommodConverter Facility, timed-release storage, (https://github.com/katyhuff/commodconverter)
\item StreamBlender Facility, source-preferential fuel fabrication, (https://github.com/katyhuff/streamblender)
\item MktDrivenInst, a market-driven institution, (https://github.com/katyhuff/mktdriveninst)
\end{itemize}
