To extend the capabilities of the Cyclus ecosystem to include market-driven 
decommissioning, physics agnostic separations, simple storage, and 
source-preferential fuel fabrication, the following Agents were developed:

\begin{itemize}
\item SeparationsMatrix Facility, physics agnostic separations
\item CommodConverter Facility, timed-release storage
\item StreamBlender Facility, source-preferential fuel fabrication 
\item DecommInst, a market-driven decommissioning institution.
\end{itemize}
