A number of exsiting capabilities were used to acheive this simulation. One is
the GrowthRegion, which can maintain a power profile according to a demand
curve. Another is the BatchReactor, which generically represents multi-batch
reactor models with fresh and spent fuel material compositions defined by the user. The
Source Facility and Sink Facility produce and consume material, respectively.  
Accordingly, they represent the Mine and HLW Repository in this simulation. The 
details can be seen in Table \ref{tab:facimpl} and Figure \ref{fig:cycic_img}.  
Other capabilities had to be contributed, however. This section describes those 
capabilities.
