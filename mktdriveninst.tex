\subsection{Market Driven Institution}
\label{sec:mktdriveninst}
A new Institution Agent has been based on an already existing institution
model in Cycamore and added a market-driven deployment capability to faithfully 
model this scenario.  That is, by relying on inheritance from a mix-in class 
already available within the \Cyclus toolkit, an institution can deploy and 
decommission facilities based on any decision criteria. By also relying on the 
dynamic resource exchange interface, it is possible to base that decision 
criteria on the availability of resources being offered by other facility 
agents in the simulation. 

In this case, a specific quantity of separated transuranic material must exist 
before an \gls{LWR} can be decommissioned (to be replaced with three \glspl{SFR}). That 
decision criteria, combined with the capability of decommissioning facilities, 
gives the Market Driven Institution.
